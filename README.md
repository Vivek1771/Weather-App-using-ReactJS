## Weather App

A weather app done with React. Allows the user to search for the weather in their cities and save them to favorites.

Utilises [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather data and [Weather Icons](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for icons.  
[Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) was also used in this project.
